Problem 5: Utilizing Social Media to alert about new disasters and their nature

Problem Statement: The students will design and implement a web-tool or an app for rapid alert and notification about a disastrous event, in close to real time. The tool will alert about the event, similar, for example, to earthquake or tsunami warnings that appear on Google's home page immediately after a major disaster. While traditional methods for alerting on such events rely on official information derived from official sources (e.g. USGS), this tool will utilize social media activity to identify these events and alert when an event first occurs.
